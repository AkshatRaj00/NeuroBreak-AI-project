        "Here's a quick mindfulness exercise: Take three deep breaths and then notice - what sounds do you hear right now? What do you feel in your body? What thoughts are present?",
        "Try this body scan: Starting from your toes, slowly move your attention up through your body, noticing any sensations without trying to change them.",
        "Mindfulness simple exercise: Sirf 1 minute ke liye apni saans par focus kariye. Jab mind wander kare, gently wapas saans par attention le aayiye.",
        "Place your feet flat on the ground and really feel that connection. Notice the weight of your body in the chair. This is grounding - connecting with the present moment.",
        "Look around you and pick one object. Study it closely for 30 seconds - its color, texture, shape. This pulls your mind into the present moment and away from worry."
